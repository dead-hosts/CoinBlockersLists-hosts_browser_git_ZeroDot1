# About Dead-hosts

[Dead-Hosts](https://github.com/dead-hosts) is the replacement of the original idea behind [funilrys/dead-hosts](https://github.com/funilrys/dead-hosts).
Indeed, the idea was to test - with the help of PyFunceble and Travis CI - hosts file, list of domains or even bocklist to have a list of only active domains or IP.

Today, we provide our infrastructure for anybody who want it. [Just ask](https://github.com/dead-hosts/dev-center/issues/new?template=inclusion-request.md)!
